    "$\\text{1a) Minimizing least squares is the procedure that allows us to find estimates of the coefficients in linear regression such that our predictions}$\n",
    "$\\text{are as close to the actual data points as possible. This creates the line of best fit.}$\n",
    "$\\text{To find these coefficients, we want to minimize the distance between our predicted } \\hat{Y} \\text{ given an observation X, and the actual (X,Y) from the training set.}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Here, this is done by minimizing the residuals from our model, or the difference between}$\n",
    "$\\text{our models prediction, }\\hat{Y} \\text{, and the actual Y of the training response variable.}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Let }Y=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\epsilon_{1} \\text{ and } Y=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\epsilon_{2}$\n",

    "$\\text{Then, }$\n",

    "$RSS_1=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_1 ^2 =(y_i - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_1)^2$\n",

    "$\\text{We can see that the first model is a more restrictive version of the second. In the second model, if }\\beta_2=0\\text{ minimizes }RSS_{12}$ $\\text{then model 2 will find that. In contrast, model 1 can be thought of as ignoring the second feature } X_2 \\text{ no matter what, leaving the possibility that}$\n",
